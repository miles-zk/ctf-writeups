# Crypto, Forensics, General Skills (02/28/2025)
This was the most productive night I've had on Pico yet, solving many medium difficulty challenges in the Cryptography, Forensics, and General Skills categories. It was a total of 12 challenges, but some of them were very simple so I've narrowed it down to the 8 most interesting ones.
